# RaphaÃ«l SVG Import plugin

## What is it?
An extension to the Raphael Vector Library.<br/>
It enables Raphael to import raw SVG data.

Fork Notes
==========

This is a fork of [raphael.svg-import](https://github.com/wout/raphael-svg-import).
When the original raphael-svg-import reached 0.0.3, a major backwards-incompatible change was introduced.
Instead of parsing SVG documents, it used regular expressions. This was undesirable for several reasons:

* Used regular expressions to parse XML. Rebuilding something that browsers can do natively.
* Loss of document structure. Groups (`<g>`) are lost.
* Additional steps needed to load a svg file.

Usage
-----
See demo.html for the full example. Use AJAX to retrieve your SVG file as an XML document.
Then use importSVG() to convert the SVG into a raphael.js set:

    jQuery(document).ready(function(){
      jQuery.ajax({
        type: "GET",
        url: "assets/demo.svg",
        dataType: "xml",
        success: function(svgXML) {
          var paper = Raphael(10, 10, 800, 600);
          var newSet = paper.importSVG(svgXML);
        }
      });
    });

If you want the Raphael paper dimensions to automatically match the SVG:

    jQuery(document).ready(function(){
      jQuery.ajax({
        type: "GET",
        url: "assets/demo.svg",
        dataType: "xml",
        success: function(svgXML) {
          var root = svgXML.getElementsByTagName('svg')[0].getAttribute('viewBox').split(' ');
          var width = root[2],
              height = root[3];
          var paper = Raphael(width, height);
          var newSet = paper.importSVG(svgXML);
        }
      });
    });

If you want to import the SVG from an element within the page you can access to the element:

    <svg id="mysvg" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px"
	 width="500px" height="500px" viewBox="0 0 500 500" enable-background="new 0 0 500 500" xml:space="preserve">
    	<circle opacity="0.3" fill="#FF0000" enable-background="new" cx="251.5" cy="255.5" r="179"/>
    </svg>

And you can access to the svg element by its id:

    var paper = Raphael(10, 10, 500, 500);
    var newSet = paper.importSVG(document.getElementById('mysvg'));

In the assets folder a demo.svg file is provided.<br/>
Nothing fancy but it gives you a starting point.

Final Notes
-----------
I've tried keeping all the files as close to the original as possible.
So there are lots of files not relevant to this fork in the tree.

There is a bug in the minified version of of Raphael.js that most people use.
It's best to just grab the uncompressed source and minify it yourself.
